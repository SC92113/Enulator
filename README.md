# Enulator
### One of the products collaborated in Ampd

### Overview
At Ampd Energy, we developed and launched the Enulator platform, taking it from the MVP stage to a full release with the help of our design and engineering teams. The main goal of Enulator was to create a smooth pre-sales management tool that handled everything from inputting data to generating customized sales proposals, so that sales officers and distributors can convince potential customers to buy or rent our battery energy storage system (BESS) called Enertainer through the proposals. We wanted to solve several user problems, like the need for separate cost and carbon saving calculation, proposal styling, flexible customization in proposal PDF, and offering both Presentation and Condensed versions of proposals. It also aimed to improve the efficiency of managing proposal data, configuration, and user access. Initially, we launched the MVP internally for sales officers and gathered their feedback to refine and enhance the tool for its full release.
